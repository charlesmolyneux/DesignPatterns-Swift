# Proxy - Creational

## Summary
The Proxy Pattern allows us to restrict access control to another object, as well as being a placeholder for another object.

By Proxy classes acting as a placeholder for another class we can before operations prior or post a request reaching the original object.  

The Proxy Pattern is similar to the Adapter, the key difference being the Proxy pattern shares the same interface as the class it's acting as a placeholder for.
