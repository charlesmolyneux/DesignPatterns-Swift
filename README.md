##

This project features examples of implementing the most commonly used design patterns using Swift. 

Design patterns can help provide solutions to reoccurring problems that often appear during Software Design and development. This repository heavily inspired from the examples provided at refactoring.guru[<sup>1</sup>](#1) will hopefully give you a better understanding of how these patterns can be applied to real world problems. 

## Creational
#####  Intent: Creational patterns provide methods to help increase the reusability of your code by making object creation simpler and more flexible.

 - [Factory](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Factory.md)
- [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Factory.md)
- [Builder](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Builder.md)
- [Prototype](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Prototype.md)
- [Singleton](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Singleton.md)

## Structural
#####  Intent: Structural patterns assist in constructing objects into larger components, promoting flexibility and interoperability.

 - Adapter
 - Decorator
 - Facade
 - Composite
 - Proxy - To Be Implemented 
 - Bridge  - To Be Implemented 
 - Flyweight - To Be Implemented 

## Behavioural
#####  Intent: Behavioural patterns are concerned with the assignment of responsibilities, separating responsibilities and algorithms into their own classes.

 - [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Chain%20Of%20Command.md)
- [Command](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Command.md)
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method - To Be Implemented 
- Visitor - To Be Implemented 
-  Iterator - To Be Implemented 
- Mediator - To Be Implemented 
- Memento - To Be Implemented
