# This is a work in progress, expect iteration 1 to be complete by November 21st. 

## Introduction
This project features examples of implementing the most commonly used design patterns using Swift.
Included is an xcode project with examples of the patterns being used as well as some high-level documentation available on this repostitory page!
I'll be adding to these pages as I make more time to provide more in-depth examples.
Any feedback is welcomed!

## What Are Design Patterns
Design patterns help provide solutions to reoccurring problems that often appear during Software Design.
This repository has taken inspiration from examples provided at refactoring.guru[<sup>1</sup>](#1) as well as the Gang of Four book[<sup>2</sup>](#2).
I hope it will give you a better understanding of how these patterns can be applied to real world problems in a simple manner.

## Creational
#####  Intent: Creational patterns provide methods to help increase the reusability of your code by making object creation simpler and more flexible.

 - [Factory](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Creational/Factory.md)
- [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Creational/Factory.md)
- [Builder](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Creational/Builder.md)
- [Prototype](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Creational/Prototype.md)
- [Singleton](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Creational/Singleton.md)

## Structural
#####  Intent: Structural patterns assist in constructing objects into larger components, promoting flexibility and interoperability.

 - [Adapter](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Structural/Adapter.md)
 - [Decorator](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Structural/Decorator.md)
 - [Facade (To be Written)](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Structural/Facade.md)
 - [Composite](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Structural/Composite.md)
 - [Proxy](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Structural/Proxy.md) - To Be Implemented & Written
 - Bridge  - To Be Implemented
 - Flyweight - To Be Implemented

## Behavioural
#####  Intent: Behavioural patterns are concerned with the assignment of responsibilities, separating responsibilities and algorithms into their own classes.

 - [Chain of Responsibility](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Behavioural/ChainOfCommand.md)
- [Command](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Behavioural/Command.md)
- [Observer](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Behavioural/Observer.md)
- [State](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Behavioural/State.md)
- [Strategy](https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Behavioural/Strategy.md)
- Template Method - To Be Implemented
- [Visitor]((https://github.com/charlesmolyneux/DesignPatterns-Swift/blob/master/Documentation/Behavioural/Visitor.md)) - Work in Progress
-  Iterator - To Be Implemented
- Mediator - To Be Implemented
- Memento - To Be Implemented
