Name: Observer
Pattern Type: Behavioural
Aliases: Event-Subscriber, Listener

Summary:
  The Observer Pattern lets you define a subscription mechanisim to notify 'n' objects about events these objects are observing.
 
Example:
  A Product is out of stock on a website, users can subscribe to be notified about stock changes.
  A balance textfield observes changes to the balance amount, gets notified of any changes and re-displays.

Pros:
  - SRP: Establish relationships between objects at runtime
  - OCP: Introduce new subscriber classes without having to change the publishers code

 Cons:
 - Subscribers are notified in random order
