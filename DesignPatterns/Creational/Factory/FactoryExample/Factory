Factory Method
Pattern Type: Creational
Aliases: Virtual Constructor
 
 Summary
  Replace direct object construction and instead use a factory method.

 Pros:
 - Avoid tight coupling between creator and the concrete objects/products.
 - SRP: Moves object creation code into one place.
 - Open/Closed Principle: Can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing code.
 
 Cons:
 - Code can increase in complexity if you're introducing a large number of subclasses to implement the pattern.
