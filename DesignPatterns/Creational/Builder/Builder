Name: Builder
Pattern Type: Creational
Aliases: N/A

Summary:
  The Builder Pattern allows you to create complex objects in a step by step manner.
  This pattern enables you to construct different types and representations of an objecting using the same construction code.
 
Example:
  Building up a Query for a Netork Service
  Building UI Components

Pros:
  - Can construct objects step-by-step, defer steps or run steps recursively.
  - Allows construction code to be reused.
  - SRP: Isolates complex construction code from business logic.
 
 Cons:
 - Overall app complexity increases as this pattern requires creating multiple new classes.
