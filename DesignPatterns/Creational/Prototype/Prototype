Name: Prototype
Pattern Type: Creational
Aliases: Clone
 
 Summary:
  Allows you to copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.
 
 Example:
  You have a 'Shape' object. You also have a 'Rectangle' and 'Circle' object, both conform/subclass the 'Shape' object.
  Prototype pattern would allow us to produce copies of these geometric shapes without coupling the code to their classes.
  This way the subclasses (i.e. Circle) can construct itself with its own field values before copying.
  
 Pros:
 - Allows cloning of objects without coupling to their concrete class
 - Removes repeated initalisation in favour of cloning pre-build prototypes.
 - Can produce complex objects more easily
 - Can use instead of inheritance when dealing with configuration presets.
 
 Cons:
 - Can end up with circular references when cloning objects with a greater complexity.
